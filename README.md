# SmoothClips
This Python code analyzes a video to identify and extract smooth, stable segments. It calculates motion variation using optical flow, then computes standard deviation and relative changes per second. Based on a defined threshold, it identifies segments with consistently low motion fluctuation. To avoid redundancy, it filters out overlapping segments. Finally, it utilizes ffmpeg to extract the selected smooth segments into separate video clips, providing detailed debugging information throughout the process for analysis and troubleshooting. This enables the extraction of stable video portions, suitable for applications requiring consistent and visually appealing footage.
